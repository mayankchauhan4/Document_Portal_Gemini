       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of France. Let me think... I remember that France is a country in Europe. The capital is a major city. I think it's Paris. Wait, isn't Paris known for the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre? Yeah, that sounds right. But maybe I should double-check to be sure. I don't want to give incorrect information. Let me recall any other possibilities. Some people might confuse it with Lyon or Marseille, but those are not capitals. The capital of France is definitely Paris. I'm pretty confident about that. I'll go ahead and state that Paris is the capital of France.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It is renowned for its cultural landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, making it one of the most iconic cities in the world.\""
